This is an Arduino library for most of the FPMxx/R30x/ZFMxx/R551 optical fingerprint sensors.\
(*See note below.*)

Included are a Python script and a Windows executable for extracting fingerprint images to a PC; 
the `image_to_pc` example must first be uploaded to the Arduino. \
For optimal reliability, baud rates <= 57600 are recommended regarding `SoftwareSerial` usage, 
especially when retrieving fingerprint images.

A generic version of this [library in C](https://github.com/brianrho/FPM-C).\
An Arduino library for the [GT511C3 (and similar GT5x) fingerprint sensors](https://github.com/brianrho/GT5X).\
\
**Note**: 
* The R308 is **not** supported for now as it lacks certain commands supported by most other sensors and needed by this library.

* The R551 seems to have clones, and a datasheet/SDK inconsistent with the sensor's actual behaviour.\
To use one of them with this library, make sure to uncomment `FPM_R551_MODULE` in `FPM.h`.
However, they generally have trouble working with the library, particularly more advanced functionality like image/template downloads.\
To take full advantage of the available functionality, it's recommended you get an FPM10, R305/7 or ZFM60,\
especially the first which has been well-tested with this library.
